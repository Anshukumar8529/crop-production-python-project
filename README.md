🌾 Crop Production Analysis in India

This project explores agricultural crop production trends across various Indian states using publicly available data from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/). It focuses on identifying top crops and states by production, analyzing crop-wise trends, and studying the relationship between rainfall and crop yield.

📊 Project Objectives

- Identify the top 10 crops by total production.
- Find the top 10 states with the highest agricultural output.
- Analyze crop-wise production trends over time.
- Study the relationship between rainfall and yield.
- Present key insights using effective visualizations.


- **Data Includes:**
  - Crop names
  - Production values (in tonnes)
  - State-wise data
  - Rainfall data
  - Year-wise trends

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

 📈 Visualizations

- Top 10 crops by production (Bar chart)
- Top 10 states by production (Bar chart)
- Year-wise production trend for selected crops (Line chart)
- Rainfall vs. yield correlation (Scatter plot)

🧠 Insights

- Wheat and Rice are among the highest produced crops across India.
- Punjab and Uttar Pradesh are leading states in crop production.
- Certain crops show strong correlation between rainfall and yield.

 📌 Purpose

This project helps:
- Understand which crops are most productive and where.
- Farmers and policymakers make data-driven decisions.
- Explore how rainfall patterns impact crop yield.
